title: Introducing 100 Warm Tunas News

Historically it's been difficult to communicate changes made to the data collection process that result in the rankings and counts decreasing/changing dramatically.

For this reason, I have introduced a "news" website, which is a simple blog that will be used to communicate such events.

In addition to these, it will become the new home of analysis posts and other information about the site. I have ported all of the 100 Warm Tunas content from [nickwhyte.com](https://nickwhyte.com) over to this site.
