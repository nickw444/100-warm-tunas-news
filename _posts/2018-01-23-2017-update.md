100 Warm Tunas has been happily chugging away for the last month or so. I've obtained a fair amount of media coverage too.

A couple of days back, we posted the site to the [triplej subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/triplej). Someone replied to the post telling me my vote count was significantly less than what they had been counting by hand, which made me somewhat suspicious â€“ was there a bug in my Instagram scraping library that we built?

Well, after a bit of debugging early this morning, we found that there was indeed a bug. Not a bug with our scraping library, but rather a bug with how we were using the library:

{% highlight patch %}
-    for page in ig.fetch_pages('triplej', per_page=10):
+    for page in ig.fetch_pages(hashtag, per_page=10):
         for post in page.posts:
             if post.is_video:
                 logger.info("Skipping {} because it's a video".format(post.shortcode))
{% endhighlight %}

For those who are programmers, you'll probably spot the issue here. For those who aren't, the issue is that we have been using a hardcoded string to collect Instagram votes, when we thought we were collecting a handful of hashtags.

This has now been rectified and we have kicked off a full re-scrape to back-fill the data.
