Last year I predicted the top 3 in Triple J's hottest 100 (ignoring order). This year I'm back at it once again <a href="https://100warmtunas.com/2017/">with an updated webpage and a Spotify playlist</a>.

Results are collected, optimised, and processed multiple times per day. Instagram images tagged with #hottest100 and a few others are included for counting.

Happy voting!

Feel free to check out [the results from 2016](https://100warmtunas.com/2016/), [2016 results analysis]({{site.baseurl}}/2017/12/prediction-analysis-2016/), and <a href="https://nickwhyte.com/post/2016/predicting-triple-j-hottest-100-2015/">the process taken in 2015</a>.
